# WebApp_GAN
Developing a full stack application using Html, css and jinja2 for front end. 
Using Flask for back end and access saved GAN model.
The GAN models were developed during dissertation

## Step 1 
Developing a neat User intgerface using html css, and using jinja for writing html templates and frontend logic

## Step 2 
Importing all saved GAN models used in dissertaion (WGAN-GP, DCGAN, LSGAN, BiGAN)

## Step 3
Developing backend logic using flask for creating Database using Sqlachemy-Flask API

## Step 4 
Developing backend logic for registering, login and logging out a user

## Step 5 
Developing backend logic for recording the user input and interactions 

## Step 6
Developing backend logic for displaing the GAN predicted image 

## Step 7
Developing backend logic for recoding the user history in database 

## Step 8 
Developing a UI element/method allowing the user to access the history 

## Step 9 
Developing a UI element to allow user to view comparisions between the GAN gerated and orignal images 

## Step 10 (Optional)
Developing a way to allow the user to upload a folder with their images selecting a particular GAN and then notifying user once the GAN is trained
